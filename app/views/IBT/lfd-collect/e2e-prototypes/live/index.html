      Use this service to get a collect code so you can pick up rapid lateral flow test packs from a pharmacy in England.

      Your collect code does not reserve test packs for you, and tests may not be available at your preferred pharmacy.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      We'll send your collect code by email or text. You do not need a collect code in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. <a href="https://maps.test-and-trace.nhs.uk/" class="govuk-link">Find where to pick up a test near you on NHS.UK</a>.

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Collect your tests</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Take your collect code to a pharmacy. You can use your code at any pharmacy that offers this service.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      You can pick up rapid lateral flow tests for your household or another household. You should get a separate collect code for each household.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      If you're aged 15 and under your parent or guardian should pick up the rapid lateral flow tests.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Someone will record your code and give you the rapid lateral flow tests. Collect codes help the NHS understand how rapid lateral flow tests are being used in England.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      You should get a new collect code for each collection.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-top-6">Report your test</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      After youâ€™ve done your test, you should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/report-covid19-result" class="govuk-link">report your rapid lateral flow test result</a>, even if it's negative or void. Reporting helps the NHS track the spread of COVID-19
      and spot outbreaks faster.
