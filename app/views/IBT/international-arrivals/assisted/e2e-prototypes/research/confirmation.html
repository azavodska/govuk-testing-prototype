You can submit the PLF any time in the 48 hours before you arrive in the UK. You will not be able to travel if you do not complete the PLF.

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">When you get your test kits</h2>

    <p>It is important that each person on this order uses the test kit that is addressed to 
      them. This will make sure that they receive the correct test result. </p>
