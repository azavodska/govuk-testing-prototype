      <p class="govuk-body">Use this service to report your result to the NHS after using a rapid lateral flow test kit to check if you're infectious with coronavirus (COVID 19).</p>
      <p>A rapid lateral flow test is a coronavirus test you do yourself. It shows you the result on a handheld device that comes with the test.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Report the result:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>every time you use a lateral flow test kit</li>
        <li>as soon as possible after you get the result</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="govuk-inset-text">
        If you are taking daily rapid lateral flow tests because you are a contact of someone who has COVID-19, you should report your result every day.
      </div>

      <p class="govuk-body">You can’t report a result after more than 24 hours.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">You can only report one result at a time.</p>
