    <p class="govuk-body">In Northern Ireland, the current recommendation is that everyone over 11 years of age takes regular rapid lateral flow tests, particularly if you’re planning to mix with other people.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Everyone who does not have symptoms should take a rapid lateral flow test before:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>meeting friends and family</li>
      <li>attending an event or social gathering</li>
      <li>spending time in a crowd or a busy public place</li>
      <li>visiting someone who is elderly or more vulnerable</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">All areas of testing are kept under regular review.</>
