    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How it works</h2>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">1. Get a collect code</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Before you go to the collection point, use this service to get a collect code. This is a code that you need to show when you collect your test packs. You can create an account so it’s quicker next time.
      <br><br>
      You can also get a collect code by calling 119 (free from landlines and mobiles). Lines are open from 7am to 11pm.
      <br><br>
      We’ll send your collect code by email or text. You can print your code.
    </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">2. Collect your tests</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Take your collect code to the collection point. Someone will scan your code and give you the tests.
    </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">3. Do the test</h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      After you’ve done the test, you should report your test result. We’ll tell you how to report your result when we send your collect code. You can also find this information in the test instructions.
