      <p class="govuk-body">Use this service to register a coronavirus (COVID-19) test kit so you can get the test result if:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-!-margin-bottom-6">
        <li>you were given a Test Registration Card at a test site</li>
        <li>you're doing a rapid lateral flow test at a test site</li>
        <li>you're taking part in surge testing and you're doing a PCR test</li>
        <li>you've arrived in the UK after international travel and you're doing a PCR test</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">If you are registering a test for more than one person, you need to register each test to get all the results.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Before you start</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">You'll need:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>the test kit barcode for the test you're registering</li>
        <li>a mobile phone number (for you or the person you're registering it for)</li>
        <li>the Royal Mail barcode - only if you are registering a PCR test that you will return by post</li>
        <li>the NHS number for each person taking the test (called a CHI number in Scotland and H&C number in Northern Ireland)</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-6">
        The NHS number is optional but helps us quickly save your test result to your GP record.<br><br>
        In England, entering your NHS number also means your test results can be quickly saved to an ‘NHS COVID Pass’. You may be asked to show your pass to get into some events, or to travel abroad.<br><br>
        <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/online-services/find-nhs-number/">Look up your NHS number</a>
