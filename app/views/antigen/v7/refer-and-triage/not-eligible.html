      <p>These tests are free and you get a result within 10 to 30 minutes, without having to send the test away to a laboratory.</p>
      <p>If you have rapid lateral flow test kits at home, use these first.</p>
      <p>If you do not have any at home, then picking up kits from a pharmacy is the quickest way to get a rapid lateral flow test for most people. It also frees up home delivery for those who need it the most.</p>
