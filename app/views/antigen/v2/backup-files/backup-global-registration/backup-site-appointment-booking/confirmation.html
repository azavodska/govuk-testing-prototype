    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Your test site pass</h2>

    <hr>

    <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-top-4">If you provided an email address, the pass has also been emailed to you.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">When you arrive at the test site, show the security guard your QR code to be let through. You can show them your email pass, or a screenshot or printout of the QR code.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">If you cannot show your QR code, you can instead:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>show the text message we will send you confirming your appointment booking</li>
      <li>give your date of birth</li>
      <li>give your vehicle registration number</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">But if you can, show your QR code as this makes entry easier and quicker.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">You must turn up to your appointment on time, as this will help other people to be tested on time too.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What you'll need to bring to the test site</h2>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>a copy of your test site pass (and passes for any children getting a test) which we've sent by text (and also by email, if you gave us your email address)</li>
      <li>photo ID - a driving licence or passport for each person getting a test</li>
      <li>hand sanitiser or antiseptic wipes - because we may ask you to do the test yourself, so you'll need clean hands (if you have neither, we'll provide you with a pair of latex-free gloves)</li>
      <li>face coverings for each person aged 3 years and over, if you are visiting a walk-through site</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">You may also want to bring a bottle of water, as we cannot provide water at the test site.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens at the test site</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">You must turn up to your appointment on time, as this will help other people to be tested on time too.</p>

    <div class="govuk-warning-text">
      <span class="govuk-warning-text__icon" aria-hidden="true">!</span>
      <strong class="govuk-warning-text__text">
        <span class="govuk-warning-text__assistive">Warning</span>
        If you're visiting a walk-through test-site, you must arrive by foot or bicycle and wear a face covering.
      </strong>
    </div>

    <p class="govuk-body">You'll stay in your vehicle or testing bay during your visit.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Depending on which site you go to, you'll either be asked to do the test yourself (with instructions) or an assistant will do the swab test for you. Staff will let you know which test you'll be doing when you arrive at the test site.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">

      <a class="govuk-link" href="#">learn about walk-through sites</a>
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">It usually takes no more 10 minutes to perform the test. You may have to wait to be tested, but you would not usually be at the test centre for more than an hour.</p>
    
    <p class="govuk-body">You'll receive your test results by text message. Most people get their results within 48 hours, but it could take up to 5 days.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If you're bringing a baby or a child</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">If you're bringing a child aged 11 or under to be tested, you (their parent or guardian) will be asked to swab test your child. You'll be given paper instructions.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">You'll swab test your child either in a testing bay (walk-through) or from the back seat of your vehicle (drive-through). If you're going to a drive-through site, you may want to bring another adult, so one of you can already be seated in the back when you arrive. Otherwise, you'll need to climb onto the back seat.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">You'll not be able to leave the vehicle or the testing bay during the test.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Before you swab test your child, you'll need to read the paper instructions. It can take about 20 minutes to read the instructions and then do the test.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">You may want to bring something to keep your child entertained while you read and then swab yourself.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Do you need a BSL interpreter?</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">If you are Deaf and need a BSL interpreter during your drive-through test, <a href="#">download the free InterpreterNow app</a> before you appointment.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">We want to hear from you</h2>
