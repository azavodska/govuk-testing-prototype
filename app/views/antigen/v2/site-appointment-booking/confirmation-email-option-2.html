      You'll receive your test results by text message. Most people get their result the next day, but it may take up to 3 days.<br><br>
      If you do not get your result by day 6, call the coronavirus testing contact centre on 119. The contact centre is open from 7am to 11pm.

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If you're bringing a baby or a child</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">If you're bringing a child aged 11 or under to be tested, you (their parent or guardian) will be asked to swab test your child. You'll be given paper instructions.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">You'll swab test your child either in a testing bay (walk-through) or from the back seat of your vehicle (drive-through). If you're going to a drive-through site, you may want to bring another adult, so one of you can already be seated in the back when you arrive. Otherwise, you'll need to climb onto the back seat.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">You'll not be able to leave the vehicle or the testing bay during the test.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Before you swab test your child, you'll need to read the paper instructions. It can take about 20 minutes to read the instructions and then do the test.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">You may want to bring something to keep your child entertained while you read and then swab yourself.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Antibody testing</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-8">
      If you agreed to do antibody testing, you may receive an antibody test kit in the post, 2-3 days after you get a positive PCR test result. Your 2nd antibody test kit will arrive 3 weeks after the first one.<br><br>
      The kit contains clear instructions on how to do the test. It's important you do the test and post it back <strong>as soon as possible.</strong> You can leave home to post a test kit while self isolating. <a href="#">Find more info on how to prepare for, take and return the antibody test.</a>
