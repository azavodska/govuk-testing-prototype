              <strong>They will only receive an antibody test kit if they test positive for coronavirus.</strong><br><br>
              The antibody test is a 'fingerprick' blood test to see if you've had a previous infection. This will help the NHS learn more about who's had the virus more than once, and how it has spread.<br><br>
              They will be sent 2 antibody test kits. The kits will arrive by post at their home address 3 weeks apart. They do each test on themselves at home. They can ask a friend or relative to help.<br><br>
              The antibody tests have to be completed and posted back straight away. It's safe to leave home to post a test while you are self-isolating.

                  There are a few things you need to do to prepare before doing your test, like drinking lots of water, soaking your hand in warm water and exercising if safe to do so.<br><br>
                  Next, you'll use a lancet to prick the corner of your fingertip. It's only a small prick and you won't see any of the needle.<br><br>
                  You'll then massage your hand, and fill your tube to the 600 line. Then you'll put the cap on and slowly turn the tube upside down.<br><br>
                  Finally, you'll label your tube, package everything up and pop it in a postbox.
