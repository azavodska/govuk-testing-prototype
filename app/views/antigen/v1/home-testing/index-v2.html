    <p class="govuk-body-l">When you're doing a coronavirus (COVID-19) test, you need to register the test kit so you can get your result.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body-l">There are different ways to register a COVID-19 test kit. The register service you need to use depends on why you're doing the test, and how you got the test kit. At some test sites, staff will register your kit for you.</p>

    <div class="govuk-inset-text">
      Registering a test kit is different to reporting a test result. You need to report your test result if you're using a rapid lateral flow self-test kit at home or at work. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/" target="_blank">Report a COVID-19 rapid lateral flow test result on GOV.UK</a> </div>
